Estonian guerrilla opendata repository

There is a lot of data out there. Some of it is Estonian. Some of it is easily accessible but many things are not. The Estonian open-data initiatives are definitely laudable (http://www.riso.ee/et/avaandmete-roheline-raamat) but it takes time to open all the interesting data in a standardized way. This is where the community can help by finding the data, documenting it, creating scraping scripts etc. 

This repository is meant to collect information on what data is openly available where using what means. 

Add source code, URLs and documentation you find. 

Only add things that are meant to be public. I.e. if you get your hands on a URL with sensitive personal data, this is NOT the place to share it.
