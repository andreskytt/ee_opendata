Estonian guerrilla opendata repository

There is a lot of data out there. Some of it is Estonian. Some of it is easily accessible but many things are not.

This repository is meant to collect information on what data is available where using what means. 

Add source code, URLs and documentation you find. 

Only add things that are meant to be public. I.e. if you get your hands on a URL with sensitive personal data, this is NOT the place to share it.
